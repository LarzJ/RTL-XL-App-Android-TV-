# Orginal RTL XL App for Android TV (Philips/TP Vision)

This app was orginal released on an Philips (TP-vision) Android TV.
My goal was to install this app on a other device so I can playback some tv programs of RTL Nederland.

The problem is that the app wont run.... The Appicon wil show in the menu. But when u open the app it crashed immediately. 

Maybe some smart guy can make a patched version of the app so it works on other devices.

## App information:
version 41<br>
